# Angular2 Skeleton

## Setup

To get started, `cd` into the project directory and run:

```bash
  npm install
```

This pulls down TypeScript, Angular2, and other dependencies we need.

```bash
  npm run start
```

This command will run the TypeScript compiler on watch mode. And it will also start up a webserver

## Testing

The tests are found locally at [/jasmine.html](http://localhost:3000/jasmine.html). To add a new test create
a TypeScript file within `/spec` and link to the compiled file within `jasmine.html`
